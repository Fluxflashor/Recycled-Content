                <h2>We're Recycled Content <span class="smalltext">Just like World of Warcraft!</span></h2>
                <p>We are a progression focused guild on Bleeding Hollow US. We consider ourselves in the realm of "hardcore-casual" because we only raid a couple of nights a week but we expect our team to come prepared to slay dragons.</p>

                <h2>Open Slots</h2>
                <p>These are our currently open positions. We prefer that all DPS are flexible in their damage-dealing specs, especially on a boss by boss basis. Tanks and Heals should also feel comfortable as DPS.</p>
                <p>You're also welcome to talk to us if your class isn't listed below - we're flexible!</p>
                <p>If you're any of these specs, hit us up on <a href="https://recycledcontent.net/discord">Discord</a>!</p>
